While similar questions may be on-topic here, this one was resolved in a way less likely to help future readers.\nClosed 24 mins ago.\nI started learning javascript and created a simple to-do web app to practice. However, an error that is breaking me apart is appearing, for example, i have an array with all the tasks which will store the tasks, then i will get the task content from the creation of the task and push it into the array and finally create the task element for the html part. But i dont know why, when the html part is created, the first element created always comes with two tasks, one saying what the content was and another saying undefined. The other tasks show up normal.\n\nAs you can see, when i  created task1 the undefined one showed up, and i dont know why this is hapening...\nAnd in the console, the array is working fine:\n\nHere is the relevant code:\nlet add = document.querySelector(\"#add\")\nlet tasksArray = []\n\nlet taskContent = document.querySelector(\"#task-content\")\n\nadd.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  let task = \"\"\n  tasksArray.push(taskContent.value);\n  for (let index = 0; index <= tasksArray.length; index++) {\n    task +=\n      `\n        <div class=\"task\">\n            <input type=\"checkbox\">\n            <span id=\"task-name\">${tasksArray[index]}</span>\n            <span class=\"material-symbols-outlined\" id=\"mark-as-important\">grade</span>\n        </div>\n        `\n  }\n  document.querySelector(\".tasks-list\").innerHTML = task;\n\n\n  console.log(tasksArray);\n})\n<div class=\"add-task\">\n  <span id=\"task-title\">Add new task</span>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"task-content\">\n  <button type=\"submit\" id=\"add\">Add</button>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"tasks-list\">\n\n</div>\nBy my understanding of the code, the tasksArray[index] is returning undefined but still, why is it showing up two times, one correct and another undefined??\nI have tried changing the position of the code various times or even trying to eliminate the task that said \"undefined\" but it didn't work. I dont really know how to fix this. I was expecting that the undefined task would disappear but it just would not.",

For some reason, the paintComponent() method is called twice and I don't understand why that is the case.\nI know that the first call to paintComponent() is triggered by the background change in the constructor fucntion. The second call is made somewhere inside startGame(), since after running the program, the apple coordinates are updated, meaning that paintComponent() is called sometime after newApple().\nThank you for taking some time to help a fellow programmer out ^^!",

FYKI, I have no experience in writing these kinds of low-level asynchronous methods other than consuming existing ones.\nThe following code section has an example wrapper method ConnectAsync() that I have written on my own. I have used TaskCompletionSource based on the assumption that the target operation is mostly asynchronous and I/O bound operation as it involves a network call.\nI want to know if my method is actually correct or not and do further possible optimizations here. I would welcome any rewrites of this method if I'm incorrect or inefficient.\nFor reference, the full signature of the target method Connect_Net is:\nThe following is the way I want to consume it:",

This function is the only one \"interacting\" with IDs, so it is not that I am taking the lock \"somewhere else\" for too long.\nAs per Tokio docs:\nAs a rule of thumb, using a synchronous mutex from within asynchronous code is fine as long as contention remains low and the lock is not held across calls to .await\nI think I am following these rules.",

            "content": "Let's consider the following code:\nThis compiles fine without warnings with GCC and compiler flags -std=c90 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra.\nBut K&R (2e) don't show such code in their book; they only ever usetypedefs for function pointers. (Their discussion on p147 is problematic, but that aspect is not the subject of this question.) I don't have access to the C89/C90 standard documents.\nAccording to the C standards documents (C99 TC3 (ISO/IEC 9899:TC3) draft, 6.7.7 \u00b67; C11 draft, 6.7.8 \u00b67; C17 draft, 6.7.8 \u00b67; text identical (modulo formatting) in all three documents):\nAll three of the following declarations of the signal function [from <signal.h>] specify exactly the same type, the first without making use of any typedef names.\nFor what it's worth, Wikipedia claims:\nThe C and C++ syntax [with typedefs for function pointer types] given above is the canonical one used in all the textbooks - but it's difficult to read and explain. Even the above typedef examples use this syntax. However, every C and C++ compiler supports a more clear and concise mechanism to declare function pointers: use typedef, but don't store the pointer as part of the definition. Note that the only way this kind of typedef can actually be used is with a pointer - but that highlights the pointer-ness of it.\n[...]\nThe implication of their phrasing is that allowing typedefs for bare function types is a compiler extension but not sanctioned by the standards. Is that really so? My quote from the C99 TC3, C11, and C17 standards clearly demonstrates that such typedefs are legal at least since C99 TC3. Are typedef declarations to bare function types (ie: not function pointers) legal in C89/C90? Note that the example \"given above\" that Wikipedia refers to (not quoted here) is a C++ example, so it's also possible that it's always been legal in standard C but just not in C++.",
